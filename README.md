# tfConvo
The Aim of This Project Is To Train Convolution Neutral Network With Your Own Data

There are 4 steps needed to be done:
1. Prapare your own image data using python package Captcha
2. Turn your image data into TFRecords and implement the method to read and decode TFRecords files
tfr.py implement basic function to write and decode tfrecords file
3. Construct your own Convolution Neutral Network Model
4. Train your Model with you own data

demo0922.py can run without error, but its prediction accuarcy goes down as the training times increase.  What is the problem?
